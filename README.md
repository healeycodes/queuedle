Queuedle is a daily word sliding puzzle game. Slide rows and columns of a 5x5 letter grid to form valid English words, using a queue of upcoming letters. Each move consumes a letter from the queue, and each row or column can only be slid in one direction per game. The goal is to form as many words as possible for the highest score.

## AI Solver
