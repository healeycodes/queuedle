A daily word sliding puzzle game â€“ play it on [queuedle.com](https://queuedle.com).

Slide rows and columns of a 5x5 letter grid to form valid English words, using a queue of upcoming letters. Each move consumes a letter from the queue, and each row or column can only be slid in one direction per game. The goal is to form as many words as possible for the highest score.

## AI Solver

To run the AI solver that finds optimal solutions for the daily puzzle:

The solver uses a best-first search algorithm to explore possible moves and find high-scoring solutions. It will output the best move sequence and final score to the console.
